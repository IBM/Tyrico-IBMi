## Tyrico demo

Here we show a brief demo of Tyrico. In the right terminal we are running the Tyrico jar which will relay messages between our IBM i and our AI model residing on separate machine. On the left terminal, we run a cpp program which is utilizing the Tyrico cpp client library. Using this setup, we are able to classify 100,000 iris flowers in 28 seconds.
